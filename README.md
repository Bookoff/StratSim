# StratSim
Formula 1 strategy simulator for optimising and planning tyre and pit stop strategies.

StratSim is designed to automatically optimise race strategies for teams competing in the Formula 1 World Championship.
It will load data from FIA provided PDFs and calculate vehicle performance coefficients from this data. Tyre strategy
is then optimised using analytical methods so that the smallest possible race time is chosen for the car, based on the
lap on which a stop is conducted and the order in which tires are used.
The system can then simulate a race to investigate how cars interact with each other, simulating overtaking, lapped cars,
and the pit stops as calculated before. Strategies can be modified to investigate the effect on the race if required, so
that further human input can change the strategies as required by events on-track.

Operating instructions can be found within the system: an instructions window provides all of the information required to
get started and then helpful icons guide the user through further functionality.
